      <h1>About</h1>
      <p class="mission padding-bottom">Our Shelter was the first humane society to be established in North America and is, today, one of the largest in the world.</p>

      <p class="padding-bottom">Our organization was founded on the belief that animals are entitled to kind and respectful treatment at the hands of humans and must be protected under the law. Headquartered in Portland, the shelter maintains a strong local presence, and with programs that extend our anti-cruelty mission across the country, we are recognized as a national animal welfare organization. We are a privately funded 501(c)(3) not-for-profit corporation, and are proud to boast more than 2 million supporters across the country.</p>

      <p class="padding-bottom">Our mission, as stated by founder Griffin p Longtin in 2017, is “to provide effective means for the prevention of cruelty to animals throughout the United States.”</p>
